### 1. Summary

This project establishes the foundation for a **universal and intelligent co-management IT system** that can be adopted by any organization regardless of its size or field of activity. Its key objectives are to:

- Define **universal elementary principles** for operating, designing, and developing a co-management system enriched by AI capabilities.
- Evaluate and select **existing software solutions** that can be modularly integrated.
- Set **integration standards** to ensure compatibility between current modules and future developments.

What was once considered a utopian vision until the early 2020s is now within reach—thanks to the transformative rise of AI.

*This is a "[Building AI course project](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/)".*

### **2. IT Superstructure (Front-office)**

DISCO’s front-office comprises three sequential functional modules:

1. **Forum**  
   A dedicated space for discussion and debate, where citizens can share ideas and initiate proposals.

2. **Collective Drafting**  
   A collaborative environment for structuring and refining proposals. Through iterative co-development, ideas are polished and prepared for formal submission.

3. **Voting**  
   Once a proposal is collectively refined, it is submitted to a democratic vote.

Note that these steps apply to each of the four essential functions of organizational management:

- **Control**  
  Ensuring that operations comply with established rules (from internal regulations to constitutional laws).

- **Audit**  
  Continuously reviewing and improving operational rules through feedback and analysis.

- **Project Management**  
  Coordinating and monitoring initiatives aimed at organizational development.

- **Operational Management**  
  Implementing decisions and organizing resources for efficient execution.

**Articial Intelligence** streamlines DISCO's front-office by automating forum moderation and summarization, enhancing real-time drafting with intelligent editing, and securing voting through impact simulation and anomaly detection.

### **3. IT Infrastructure (Back-office)**

The back-office is founded on four core principles:

- **Decentralized and Wireless Network**  
  Each citizen operates a personal computing node that contributes to a distributed network, collectively handling data collection, storage, and processing. This forms the essential backbone of our collective intelligence.

- **Modular Structure**  
  The architecture is designed for flexibility, enabling the seamless integration, replacement, or upgrade of modules as technological needs evolve.

- **Open-Source Software**  
  Relying on open-source solutions guarantees transparency, auditability, and community collaboration, thereby securing the system’s independence and long-term sustainability.

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  With capabilities in massive data analysis, process automation, and decision optimization, AI:
  - Aids in the design, development, and management of the collective system.
  - Enhances overall system functionality and adaptability (example : regulate network workload in response to surges in activity or energy shortages).

### **4. HI + AI = CI**

DISCO leverages the synergy between Human Intelligence (HI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a robust Collective Intelligence (CI):

- **Human Intelligence:**  
  Encompasses creativity, expertise, and civic engagement.

- **Artificial Intelligence:**  
  Provides distributed processing power and automated data analysis.

Together, they foster a CI characterized by:

- **Emergence:**  
  The collective outcome surpasses the simple sum of individual inputs.
- **Plasticity:**  
  The system adapts in real time to environmental changes.

### **5. Systemic Model**

DISCO adopts a streamlined [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) that is split into two interdependent layers:

- **Superstructure (Front-end) – [DICS Collaborative Management](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborative-Management)**  
  This layer provides application modules (forum, collective drafting, voting) that facilitate interaction and collective decision-making.

- **Infrastructure (Back-end) – [DIOS Operating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System)**  
  It underpins the decentralized network by managing data collection, storage, and processing, which are vital for sustaining collective intelligence.

### **6. Project Phases**

1. **Collaborative Refinement**  
   Work with the community to enhance the [DICS](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborative-Management) and [DIOS](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System) repositories by optimizing documentation, clarifying the vision, and detailing technical specifications.

2. **Integration of Existing Solutions**  
   Assemble and interconnect proven software modules progressively to construct the desired system.

3. **Definition of Integration Standards**  
   Identify existing gaps and establish clear norms and protocols to support the scalable development of new modules.

### **8. Conclusion**

DISCO represents a societal project that articulates the foundational principles for building a universal direct democracy system—applicable to any organization regardless of size or sector. The ultimate aim is to harness true collective intelligence through an innovative, AI-enhanced infrastructure.
