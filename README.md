## Summary

The DISCO project lays the foundation for a ***universal IT system for collective intelligence***. "Universal" means that it can be used by any organization regardless of its size or field of activity, from local associations to the State. 

DISCO is composed of two sub-projects :

- [DICS Collaborating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborating-System) : applications for collaborative decision making;

- [DIOS Operating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System) : operating system for a decentralized and wireless network.

Further development : DICS will be supplemented by new collaborative applications for basic management functions : control & audit, project management.

DISCO (DICS on DIOS) leverages the synergy between human and artificial intelligence to create an effective collective intelligence (HI+AI=CI) for direct democracy.

*This is a "[Building AI course project](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/)".*

## 1. IT Superstructure (Front-office

DISCO’s front-office comprises modules for the three basic sequential functions of collective decision making:

1. **Forum**  
   A dedicated space for discussion and debate, where citizens can share ideas and initiate proposals.

2. **Drafting**  
   A collaborative environment for structuring and refining proposals. Through iterative co-development, ideas are polished and prepared for formal submission.

3. **Voting**  
   Once a proposal is collectively refined, it is submitted to a democratic vote.

**Articial Intelligence** streamlines DISCO's front-office by automating forum moderation and summarization, enhancing real-time drafting with intelligent editing, and securing voting through impact simulation and anomaly detection.

## 2. IT Infrastructure (Back-office)

The back-office is founded on four core principles:

- **Decentralized and Wireless Network**  
  Each citizen operates a personal computing node that contributes to a distributed network, collectively handling data collection, storage, and processing. This forms the essential backbone of our collective intelligence.

- **Modular Structure**  
  The architecture is designed for flexibility, enabling the seamless integration, replacement, or upgrade of modules as technological needs evolve.

- **Open-Source Software**  
  Relying on open-source solutions guarantees transparency, auditability, and community collaboration, thereby securing the system’s independence and long-term sustainability.

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  With capabilities in massive data analysis, process automation, and decision optimization, AI:
  - Aids in the design, development, and management of the collective system.
  - Enhances overall system functionality and adaptability (example : regulate network workload in response to surges in activity or energy shortages).

## 3. Systemic Model

DISCO adopts a streamlined [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) that is split into two interdependent layers:

- **Superstructure (Front-end) – [DICS Collaborating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborating-System)**  
  This layer provides application modules (forum, drafting, voting) that facilitate interaction and collective decision-making.

- **Infrastructure (Back-end) – [DIOS Operating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System)**  
  It underpins the decentralized network by managing data collection, storage, and processing, which are vital for sustaining collective intelligence.

## 4. HI + AI = CI

DISCO leverages the synergy between Human Intelligence (HI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a robust Collective Intelligence (CI):

- **Human Intelligence:**  
  Encompasses creativity, expertise, and civic engagement.

- **Artificial Intelligence:**  
  Provides distributed processing power and automated data analysis.

Together, they foster a CI characterized by:

- **Emergence:**  
  The collective outcome surpasses the simple sum of individual inputs.
- **Plasticity:**  
  The system adapts in real time to environmental changes.

## 6. Further Developments

Once DISCO is operational, the following modules should be integrated into it, for collaborative management of the organization:

   - ***Control***  
  Ensuring that operations comply with established rules (from internal regulations to constitutional laws).

   - ***Audit***  
  Continuously reviewing and improving operational rules through feedback and analysis.

   - ***Project Management***  
  Coordinating and monitoring initiatives aimed at organizational development.

## 7. Conclusion

DISCO is a societal R&D project that lays the foundation for an IT system of collective intelligence, fostering a synergy between human and artificial intelligence. DISCO could trigger an evolutionary leap for human society toward the political ideal of direct democracy. Although the challenges to overcome are numerous and significant, the potential for progress toward a more efficient and humane society is remarkable.
