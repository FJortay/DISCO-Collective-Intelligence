## Summary

This project lays the foundation for a **universal and intelligent co-management IT system** that can be adopted by any organization regardless of its size or field of activity. Its key objectives are to:

- Define **universal elementary principles** for operating, designing, and developing a co-management system enriched by AI capabilities.
- Evaluate and select **existing software solutions** that can be modularly integrated.
- Set **integration standards** to ensure compatibility between current modules and future developments.

What was once considered a utopian vision until the early 2020s is now within reach—thanks to the transformative rise of AI.

*This is a "[Building AI course project](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/)".*

## 1. IT Superstructure (Front-office

DISCO’s front-office comprises modules for the three basic sequential functions of collective decision making:

1. **Forum**  
   A dedicated space for discussion and debate, where citizens can share ideas and initiate proposals.

2. **Collective Drafting**  
   A collaborative environment for structuring and refining proposals. Through iterative co-development, ideas are polished and prepared for formal submission.

3. **Voting**  
   Once a proposal is collectively refined, it is submitted to a democratic vote.

**Articial Intelligence** streamlines DISCO's front-office by automating forum moderation and summarization, enhancing real-time drafting with intelligent editing, and securing voting through impact simulation and anomaly detection.

## 2. IT Infrastructure (Back-office)

The back-office is founded on four core principles:

- **Decentralized and Wireless Network**  
  Each citizen operates a personal computing node that contributes to a distributed network, collectively handling data collection, storage, and processing. This forms the essential backbone of our collective intelligence.

- **Modular Structure**  
  The architecture is designed for flexibility, enabling the seamless integration, replacement, or upgrade of modules as technological needs evolve.

- **Open-Source Software**  
  Relying on open-source solutions guarantees transparency, auditability, and community collaboration, thereby securing the system’s independence and long-term sustainability.

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  With capabilities in massive data analysis, process automation, and decision optimization, AI:
  - Aids in the design, development, and management of the collective system.
  - Enhances overall system functionality and adaptability (example : regulate network workload in response to surges in activity or energy shortages).

## 3. Systemic Model

DISCO adopts a streamlined [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) that is split into two interdependent layers:

- **Superstructure (Front-end) – [DICS Collaborating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborating-System)**  
  This layer provides application modules (forum, collective drafting, voting) that facilitate interaction and collective decision-making.

- **Infrastructure (Back-end) – [DIOS Operating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System)**  
  It underpins the decentralized network by managing data collection, storage, and processing, which are vital for sustaining collective intelligence.

## 4. HI + AI = CI

DISCO leverages the synergy between Human Intelligence (HI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a robust Collective Intelligence (CI):

- **Human Intelligence:**  
  Encompasses creativity, expertise, and civic engagement.

- **Artificial Intelligence:**  
  Provides distributed processing power and automated data analysis.

Together, they foster a CI characterized by:

- **Emergence:**  
  The collective outcome surpasses the simple sum of individual inputs.
- **Plasticity:**  
  The system adapts in real time to environmental changes.

## 6. Further Developments

Once DISCO is operational, the following modules should be integrated into it, for collaborative management of the organization:

   - ***Control***  
  Ensuring that operations comply with established rules (from internal regulations to constitutional laws).

   - ***Audit***  
  Continuously reviewing and improving operational rules through feedback and analysis.

   - ***Project Management***  
  Coordinating and monitoring initiatives aimed at organizational development.

And, finally, at the individual and production level: a module for ***micro-enterprise management*** ...integrating "Accounting" and "Social Secretariat" modules with  public service databases for taxation and social security.

## 7. Conclusion

DISCO represents a societal project that articulates the foundational principles for building a universal direct democracy system—applicable to any organization regardless of size or sector. The ultimate aim is to harness true collective intelligence through an innovative, AI-enhanced infrastructure.
