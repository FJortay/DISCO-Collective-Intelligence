### 1. Summary  

This project aims to lay the foundations of a **universal and intelligent IT System for collective management**, usable by any type of organization, regardless of its activity or size.  

The main objectives are to:  

- Define **universal elementary principles** for the operation, design, and development of such a co-management system, integrating AI’s potential.  
- Conduct an **assessment** of existing software solutions that could serve as modules.  
- Establish **integration standards** applicable to both existing and future modules.  

Until the early 2020s, a project like DICOS seemed utopian. However, the rise of AI now makes its implementation conceivable.  

*This is a "[Building AI course project](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/)".*

### **2. IT Infrastructure (Back-office)**  

DICOS’s infrastructure is based on four fundamental principles:  

- **Decentralized and wireless network**  
  Each citizen has a personal computing node, forming a building block of a distributed network. This network pools data collection, storage, and processing capabilities, serving as the foundation of collective intelligence.  

- **Modular structure**  
  A flexible architecture allowing modules to be integrated, replaced, or upgraded as needed and as technology advances.  

- **Open-source software**  
  Using open-source solutions ensures transparency, auditability, and collaboration, securing the system’s independence and sustainability.  

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  Thanks to its capabilities (massive data analysis, process automation, decision optimization), AI:  
  - facilitates the design, development, and management of the collective management system;  
  - enhances the system’s functional potential.

### **3. IT Superstructure (Front-office)**  

The superstructure consists of three functional modules, linked in chronological order:  

1. **Forum**  
   A space for discussion and debate where popular initiatives originate. Citizens express ideas and discuss issues. Sometimes, a proposal emerges and moves to the next phase…  

2. **Collective Drafting**  
   A collaborative platform for structuring and formalizing proposals. Contributors can edit, refine, and co-develop a proposal. Often, it is then submitted for voting…  

3. **Voting**  
   The proposal, collectively drafted following a popular initiative, is submitted for a vote.  

These three steps are essential in each of the **four key functions** of organizational management:  

- **Control**  
  Ensuring compliance with operational rules (e.g., the statutes and regulations of an association, or the laws and Constitution of a state).  

- **Audit**  
  Continuous improvement of operational rules and identification of necessary adjustments.  

- **Project Management**  
  Planning, coordinating, and monitoring projects aimed at developing the organization.  

- **Operational Management**  
  Implementing decisions and organizing the necessary resources to carry them out.  

#### **Automation through Smart Contracts**  

A decentralized network is a prerequisite for a universal collective management system. However, managing the complexity of such a network—especially at scale—requires automation. This is where AI comes in, with its data processing and automation capabilities.  

For example, **smart contracts** can automatically trigger preventive procedures such as:  
- enforcing a specific rule in an association’s internal regulations or a national law when non-compliance is detected;  
- regulating the DIOS network’s workload in case of excessive activity or an energy deficit.

### **4. HI + AI = CI**  

DICOS relies on the synergy between human intelligence (IH) and artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in collective intelligence (CI):  

- **Human Intelligence**: Creativity, expertise, and civic engagement.  
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Distributed processing power and automated data analysis.  

This combination fosters collective intelligence characterized by:  

- **Emergence**: The whole exceeds the sum of individual contributions.  
- **Plasticity**: Real-time adaptation to environmental changes.

### **5. Systemic Model**  

DICOS follows a simplified [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) consisting of two complementary layers:  

- **Superstructure (Front-end) – [DICS Collaborative Management](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborative-Management)**  
  A suite of application modules (forum, collective drafting, voting) that serves as the interface for interaction and collective decision-making.  

- **Infrastructure (Back-end) – [DIOS Operating System](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System)**  
  The operating system managing the decentralized and wireless network, handling data collection, storage, and processing for collective intelligence.

### **6. Project Phases**  

1. **Collaborative refinement of [DICS](https://github.com/FJortay/DICS-Collaborative-Management) and [DIOS](https://github.com/FJortay/DIOS-Operating-System) repositories**  
   Optimizing documentation, clarifying the vision, and defining technical specifications in collaboration with the community.  

2. **Integration of existing software solutions**  
   Assembling proven modules to progressively build the desired system.
   
3. **Definition of integration standards**  
   Identifying gaps, establishing norms and protocols for developing new modules, ensuring system coherence and scalability.
